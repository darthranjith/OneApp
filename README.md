# Oneapp

My personal portfolio site coded in angular and updated regularly. It also has the POC's that I've been working on free time.

## 1 - SPICinemas Booking Checker

This POC is developed using angular and expressjs. currently hosted in my shared hosting. I hacked my shared hosting so that I can host node apps. duh!!

So basically this app, lets you select the movie which is about to open for booking but you don't know when. So select a movie click start. The app scraps the spicinemas website and check for every 10 mins whether the booking is opened or not. If it's opened, it starts to alert in high volume. This solves my one of the big time issue for booking tickets for my favorite movie.
